# 👋 Hi, I'm Denis Smirnov

I'm a Web3 strategist and educator focused on designing sustainable token economies, governance frameworks, and AI-integrated coordination systems.

🔹 Co-founder @ [DAO Builders](https://daobuilders.xyz) — tokenomics & governance lab  
🔹 Curator @ Codex Town — practical AI education for solopreneurs  
🔹 Lecturer @ Higher School of Economics — DeFi and digital asset systems  
🔹 Co-founder @ NFT Protect — securing NFT ownership & recovery

### 💡 Current interests:
– AI-native token systems  
– On-chain governance tooling  
– Cognitive frameworks for decentralized agents  
– Multi-agent systems & protocol sustainability

> “I believe the future of protocol design lies at the intersection of economics, cognition, and machine agency.”
